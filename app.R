The reasons for this observation could be manifold, ranging from higher customer expectations to other factors.

To gain a better understanding of the underlying reasons, we could conduct surveys or focus groups with customers to gather their feedback and insights about the products. Based on the findings, we could potentially adjust the pricing strategy for certain product categories that show a negative correlation between unit price and rating. Alternatively, we could focus on improving the quality and features of those products to meet customers' expectations and justify the higher price point.
